# ProxyCrawl Frontend Test

Welcome to ProxyCrawl Frontend test, if you haven't applied for a job offer yet, please do so before starting the test by emailing us at `jobs at proxycrawl dot com`

**Note:** This test only includes frontend, if you have some backend knowledge, you prefer to build the backend yourself, or you are applying for backend position [please do this one](https://github.com/proxycrawl/proxycrawl-interview-test).

## Instructions

1. Clone/fork this repository.
1. The project requires Node and gulp. Once Node and gulp are installed, install gulp `npm install --global gulp-cli` and then install the dependencies with `npm i` and run the project with `npm run dev` (**note:** the script is made for Linux/Mac computers, Windows users might need to tweak the start script).
1. You can access the app in http://localhost:3000
1. Read [Project to Build](#project-to-build) section to see what you have to build in the test.
1. Make frequent commits to the repository like you would normally do on your daily job.
1. Once you are done, if you've forked this project, you can send us the link to the github project. If you haven't, you can send us the zip file of the project (make sure it includes the `.git` folder).

## Project to build

The application is built using Node, [Koa](https://koajs.com) and the [ProxyCrawl Crawling API](https://proxycrawl.com/docs/crawling-api) for the backend and [Pug](https://pugjs.org) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) for the frontend.

Edit the views, styles and javascript files to build an application that accepts a ProxyCrawl token and an amazon.com product url and then displays the Amazon product information.

You are free to showcase your skills. There are no limitations on how the exercise should be done. It can be done like a regular form, or can be done via ajax. Make sure the app is as beautiful as possible and handles any possible errors properly. Think of it like if this app has to be deployed in production for being used by several thousand users. Remember that this is your chance to showcase what you are capable of, so try to avoid using frameworks and build something with javascript as well to showcase your skills.

_Please create a free ProxyCrawl account if you haven't done so yet to get your token for testing, the first 1000 requests are free of charge, if you need more free requests please ask the person in charge of your role application._
